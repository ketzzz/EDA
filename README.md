# EDA

This section is on Exploratory Data Analysis.

The code scrapes data from online, in this case, from https://www.basketball-reference.com.
It builds a simple app using streamlit. Within the app, we can interact and filter the data we want to view.

I used Anaconda Prompt to run this line: (make sure streamlit is installed)
```
streamlit run eda_basketball.py
```

After running this line, the app will open in your browser, and you will see something like this:

The Filter on the left side is interactive, and enables you to filter the data by the Year, Basketball Team or Position.
